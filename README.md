# Getting Started
1. Download this repository however you wish
2. `cd` into the root directory
3. Install the dependencies using the command `npm install`
4. *If you wish to create some seed data to play around with* Run `npm run seed`
5. Finally, enter `npm run start` to begin running the API server at the url http://localhost:3001

*If you wish to play around with the API, you should also look into downloading Insomnia REST. Insomnia is a development platform for
RESTful API's that allows a user to send POST/PUT/DELETE requests ontop of GET. This functionality doesn't really exist using a web browser*
